--- # Negative compile-time cases for type of method call expression
cases:
  - decl: |-
      // Call static method without return in body
      let e = A.method() // compile-time error as void cannot be used as type annotation

  - decl: |-
      // Call method without return in body
      let e = new A().method()  // compile-time error as void cannot be used as type annotation

  - decl: |-
      // Call static method with empty return in body
      let e = A.void1()  // compile-time error as void cannot be used as type annotation

  - decl: |-
      // Call method with empty return in body
      let e = new A().void2()  // compile-time error as void cannot be used as type annotation
