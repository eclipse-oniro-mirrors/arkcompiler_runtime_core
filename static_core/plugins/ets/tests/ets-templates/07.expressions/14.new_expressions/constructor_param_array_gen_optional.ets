    A class instance creation expression that refers to classes FixedArray, Array, or classes derived from Array,
    instantiated with an array element type of some class type, is a special form of array creation expression.
    When defining multiple elements of a created array, such an array creation expression must:
    - Refer to a class that contains an accessible parameterless constructor or a constructor with
    all parameters of the second form of optional parameters (see :ref:Optional Parameters); or
    - Have a default value.

    Otherwise, a compile-time error occurs.
