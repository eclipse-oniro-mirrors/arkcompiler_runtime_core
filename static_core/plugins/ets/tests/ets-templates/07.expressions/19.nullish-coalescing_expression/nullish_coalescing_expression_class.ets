       A nullish-coalescing expression checks whether the evaluation of the left-hand-side expression equals the nullish
       value:
       • If so, then the right-hand-side expression evaluation is the result of a nullish-coalescing expression.
       • If not so, then the result of the left-hand-side expression evaluation is the result of a nullish-coalescing expres-
       sion, and the right-hand-side expression is not evaluated (the operator ‘??’ is thus lazy).
       The type of a nullish-coalescing expression is a normalized union type (see Union Types) formed from the following:
           • Non-nullish variant of the type of the left-hand-side expression; and
           • Type of the right-hand-side expression.
