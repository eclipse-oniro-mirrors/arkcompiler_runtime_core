    The result of an instanceof expression is true if the actual type of evaluated expr is a subtype of T.
    Otherwise, the result is false. Generic type in the form of type name can be used as T operand of an
    instanceof expression. In this case, the check is performed against the type name, and type parameters
    are ignored.
