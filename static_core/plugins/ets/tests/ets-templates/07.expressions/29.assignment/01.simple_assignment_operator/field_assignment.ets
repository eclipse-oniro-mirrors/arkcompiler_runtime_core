  If the left-hand operand expression is a field access expression e.f (ยง7.11), possibly enclosed in one or more pairs of parentheses, then:
  - lhsExpression e is evaluated: if the evaluation of e completes abruptly, then so does the assignment expression.
  - rhsExpression is evaluated: if the evaluation completes abruptly, then so does the assignment expression.
  - If that evaluation completes normally, then the value of rhsExpression is converted to the type of the field.
    In that case, the result of the conversion is assigned to the field.
