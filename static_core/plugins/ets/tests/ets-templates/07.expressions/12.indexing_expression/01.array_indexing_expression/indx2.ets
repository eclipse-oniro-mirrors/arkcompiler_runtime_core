    If the chaining operator ‘?.’ is present, and after its application the type of object reference
    expression is an array type, then it makes a valid array reference expression, and the type of the array indexing
    expression is T.
    If the value of the expression to the left of ‘?.’ is undefined or null, then the evaluation of the entire surrounding
    primary expression stops. The result of the entire primary expression is then undefined.
