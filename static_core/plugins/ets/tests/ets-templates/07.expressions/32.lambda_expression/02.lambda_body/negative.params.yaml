cases:
  - desc: Not declared local variable in single expession lambda
    assertion: A compile-time error occurs if a local variable is used in a lambda body but is neither declared in nor assigned before it
    call: |-
        let f = (a: int, b: int) => a + b + c

  - desc: Not declared local variable in lambda body
    assertion: A compile-time error occurs if a local variable is used in a lambda body but is neither declared in nor assigned before it
    call: |-
        let f = (): int => {
            return a;
        }

  - desc: No return statement in lambda body
    assertion: If lambda signature return type is not void or never, and the execution path of the lambda body has no return statement or no single expression as a body, then a compile-time error occurs.

        let f = (a: int): Object => {
            let b = a + 1;
        }
