desc: >-
  For an expression with ternary operator condition ? expr1 : expr2, the type is inferred as follows:
  – If condition can be evaluated at compile time, the type of the whole expression is inferred from
  the expr1 (when condition is true) or expr2 (when condition is false)...
  – Otherwise, the type of the ternary expression is a normalized union of inferred types for expr1 and
  expr2.
