    Function type F with parameters FP1, ... , FPm and return type
    FR is a subtype of function type S with parameters SP1 , ... , SPn
    and return type SR if all of the following conditions are met:
    • m <= n
    • for each i <= m
        - Parameter type of SPi is a subtype of parameter type of FPi (contravariance), and
        – FPi is a rest parameter if SPi is a rest parameter.
        – FPi is an optional parameter if SPi is an optional parameter.
    • Type FR is a subtype of SR (covariance).
