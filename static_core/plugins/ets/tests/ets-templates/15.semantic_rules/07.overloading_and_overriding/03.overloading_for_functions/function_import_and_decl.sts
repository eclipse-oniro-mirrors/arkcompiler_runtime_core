    A function can be declared in, or imported to a scope. To prevent uncontrolled overloading, mixing functions that
    are declared and imported, or imported from different compilation units, is not allowed. In particular, a compile-time
    error occurs to same-name functions if:
    • Functions are imported from different compilation units;
    • Some functions are imported, while others are declared.
    It means that only the functions declared in the scope can be overloaded. The semantic check for these functions is as
    follows:
    • If signatures of functions are overload-equivalent, then a compile-time error occurs.
    • Otherwise, overloading is valid.
