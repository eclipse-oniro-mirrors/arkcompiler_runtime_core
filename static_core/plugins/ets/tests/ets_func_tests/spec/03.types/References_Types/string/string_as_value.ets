    A string object is immutable, the value of a string object cannot be changed after the object is created. The
    value of a string object can be shared.
    Type string has dual semantics, i.e.:
    • Type string behaves like a reference type (see Reference Types) if created, assigned, or passed as an argument;
    • Type string is handled as a value (see Value Types) by all string operations (see String Concatenation,
    Equality Expressions, and String Relational Operators).
