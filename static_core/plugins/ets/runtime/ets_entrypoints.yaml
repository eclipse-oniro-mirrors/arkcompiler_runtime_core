# This file describes copmiler-to-runtime entrypoints.
# Fields:
#  * properties:
#    - no_return: entrypoint doesn't jump back to the caller.
#    - external: don't generate entrypoint and bridge declarations, initialize table's element by nullptr.
#    - irtoc: entrypoint is generated by irtoc tool
#    - intrinsic: this is call of intrinsic wrapped in entrypoint bridge
#  * signature: signature of the entrypoint, the first element is the return value, the rest are arguments.
#  * entrypoint: entrypoint function name.
