# Note:
# The original script built and packed directly inside dest_and_exec_path.
# However, the ohos_copy GN action also writes temporary files into the same
# directory. If we run `rm -rf dest_and_exec_path`, it can cause race conditions
# with ohos_copy writing files, leading to build failures or missing files.
#
# Solution:
# Create a build_tmp subdirectory inside dest_and_exec_path, copy the source
# files into it, and perform the build/pack steps there. When cleaning, only
# remove build_tmp to avoid touching ohos_copyâ€™s temporary files. Finally,
# move the generated panda-declgen-1.0.0.tgz back to dest_and_exec_path so the
# GN outputs path remains unchanged.
