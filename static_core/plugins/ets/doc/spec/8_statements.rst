*Statements* are designed to control execution.

The syntax of *statements* is presented below:

.. code-block:: abnf

    statement:
        expressionStatement
        | block
        | localDeclaration
        | ifStatement
        | loopStatement

.. _Normal and Abrupt Statement Execution:

Normal and Abrupt Statement Execution
*************************************

.. meta:
    frontend_status: Done

The actions that every statement performs in a normal mode of execution are
specific for the particular kind of statement. Normal modes of
evaluation for each kind of statement are described in the following
sections.

A statement execution is considered to *complete normally* if the desired
action is performed without an error being thrown. On the contrary, a statement
execution is considered to *complete abruptly* if it causes an error thrown.

.. _Expression Statements:

Expression Statements
*********************

.. meta:
    frontend_status: Done

Any expression can be used as a statement.

The syntax of *expression statement* is presented below:

.. code-block:: abnf

    expressionStatement:
        expression
        ;

The execution of a statement leads to the execution of the expression. The
result of such execution is discarded.

.. _Block:

Block
*****

.. meta:
    frontend_status: Done

A sequence of statements (see :ref:`Statements`) enclosed in balanced braces
forms a *block*.

The syntax of *block statement* is presented below:

.. code-block:: abnf

    block:
        '{' statement* '}'
        ;

The execution of a block means that all block statements, except type
declarations, are executed one after another in the textual order of their
appearance within the block while an error is thrown (see :ref:`Errors`), or
until a return occurs (see :ref:`Return Statements`).

If a block is the body of a ``functionDeclaration`` (see
:ref:`Function Declarations`) or a ``classMethodDeclaration`` (see
:ref:`Method Declarations`) declared implicitly or explicitly with
return type ``void`` (see :ref:`Type void`), then the block can contain no
return statement at all. Such a block is equivalent to one that ends in a
``return`` statement, and is executed accordingly.

.. index::

.. _Local Declarations:

Local Declarations
******************

.. meta:
    frontend_status: Done

*Local declarations* define new mutable or immutable variables within the
enclosing context.

``Let`` and ``const`` declarations have the initialization part that presumes
execution, and actually act as statements.

.. index::
   local declaration
   let declaration
   const declaration

|

The syntax of *local declaration* is presented below:

.. code-block:: abnf

    localDeclaration:
        annotationUsage?
        ( variableDeclaration
        | constantDeclaration
        )
        ;

The visibility of a local declaration name is determined by the surrounding
function or method, and by the block scope rules (see :ref:`Scopes`). In order
to avoid ambiguous interpretation, appropriate sections of this Specification
are dedicated to a detailed discussion of the following entities:

- :ref:`if Statements`,
- :ref:`For Statements`,
- :ref:`For-Of Statements`.

The usage of annotations is discussed in :ref:`Using Annotations`.

.. _if Statements:

``if``  Statements
******************

.. meta:
    frontend_status: Done

An ``if`` statement allows executing alternative statements (if provided) under
certain conditions.

The syntax of *if statement* is presented below:

.. code-block:: abnf

    ifStatement:
        'if' '(' expression ')' thenStatement
        ('else' elseStatement)?
        ;

    thenStatement:
        statement
        ;

    elseStatement:
        statement
        ;

Type of expression must be ``boolean``, or a type mentioned in
:ref:`Extended Conditional Expressions`. Otherwise, a
:index:`compile-time error` occurs.

.. index::
   if statement
   statement
   syntax
   expression
   type
   boolean type
   conditional expression

If an expression is successfully evaluated as ``true``, then a ``thenStatement``
is executed. Otherwise, an ``elseStatement`` is executed (if provided).

Any ``else`` corresponds to the nearest preceding ``if`` of an ``if``
statement:

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

    if (Cond1)
    if (Cond2) statement1
    else statement2 // Executes only if: Cond1 && !Cond2

A :ref:`Block` can be used to combine the ``else`` part with the initial ``if``
as follows:

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

    if (Cond1) {
      if (Cond2) statement1
    }
    else statement2 // Executes if: !Cond1

If ``thenStatement`` or ``elseStatement`` is any kind of a statement but not a
block (see :ref:`Block`), then no *block scope* (see :ref:`Scopes`) is created
for such a statement.

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

    function foo(Cond1: boolean) {
      if (Cond1) let x: number = 1
      x = 2 // OK

      if (Cond1) {
        let x: number = 10;   // OK, then-block scope
        let y: number = x;
      }
      else {
        let x: number = 20   // OK, no conflict, else-block scope
        y = x;           // CTE, no y in scope
      }

      console.log(x)  // OK, prints 2
      console.log(y)  // CTE, y unknown
    }

.. _Loop Statements:

Loop Statements
***************

.. meta:
    frontend_status: Done

|LANG| has four kinds of loops. A loop of each kind can be optionally labelled
with an *identifier*. The *identifier* can be used only by the
:ref:`Break Statements` and :ref:`Continue Statements` contained in the loop body.

.. index::
   loop statement
   loop
   loop label
   break statement
   continue statement
   identifier

The syntax of *loop statements* is presented below:

.. code-block:: abnf

    loopStatement:
        (identifier ':')?
        whileStatement
        | doStatement
        | forStatement
        | forOfStatement
        ;

A :index:`compile-time error` occurs if the label *identifier* is not used
within ``loopStatement``, or is used in lambda expressions (see
:ref:`Lambda Expressions`) within a loop body.

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

    label: for (i = 1; i < 10; i++) {
        const f1 = () => {
            while (true) {
                continue label // Compile-time error
            }
        }
        const f2 = () => {
            do 
                break label // Compile-time error
            while (true)
        }
    }

.. _While Statements and Do Statements:

``while`` Statements and ``do`` Statements
******************************************

.. meta:
    frontend_status: Done

A ``while`` statement and a ``do`` statement evaluate an expression and
execute the statement repeatedly till the expression value is ``true``.
The key difference is that a ``whileStatement`` starts from evaluating and
checking the expression value, and a ``doStatement`` starts from executing
the statement.

The syntax of *while and do statements* is presented below:

.. code-block:: abnf

    whileStatement:
        'while' '(' expression ')' statement
        ;

    doStatement
        : 'do' statement 'while' '(' expression ')'
        ;

Type of expression must be ``boolean``, or a type mentioned in
:ref:`Extended Conditional Expressions`.
Otherwise, a :index:`compile-time error` occurs.

.. _For Statements:

``for`` Statements
******************

.. meta:
    frontend_status: Done

The syntax of *for statements* is presented below:

.. code-block:: abnf

    forStatement:
        'for' '(' forInit? ';' forContinue? ';' forUpdate? ')' statement
        ;

    forInit:
        expressionSequence
        | variableDeclarations
        ;

    forContinue:
        expression
        ;

    forUpdate:
        expressionSequence
        ;

Type of *forContinue* expression must be ``boolean``, or a type
mentioned in :ref:`Extended Conditional Expressions`. Otherwise, a
:index:`compile-time error` occurs.

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

    // existing variable is used as a loop index variable
    let i: number
    for (i = 1; i < 10; i++) {
      console.log(i)
    }

    // new variable is declared as a loop index variable with its type
    // explicitly specified
    for (let i: number = 1; i < 10; i++) {
      console.log(i)
    }

    // new variable is declared as loop index variable with its type
    // inferred from its initialization part of the declaration
    for (let i = 1; i < 10; i++) {
      console.log(i)
    }

.. index::
   for statement
   syntax
   variable
   declaration
   loop index variable
   type
   inferred type
   initialization

A variable declared in the *forInit*-part has the loop scope. It can be used
in a *forContinue* expression, a *forUpdate* expression, a single-body
statement, or in a body block if enclosed in parentheses:

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

    // forInit declaration and no body block
    let k: number = 0
    for (let i: number = 1; i < 10; i++)
      k += i
    console.log(k)
    // i =  k  // CTE when uncommented
    let i: number = k  // OK

|

.. _For-Of Statements:

``for-of`` Statements
*********************

.. meta:
    frontend_status: Partly
    todo: type of element for strings

A ``for-of`` loop iterates elements of ``array`` or ``string``, or an instance
of *iterable* class or interface (see :ref:`Iterable Types`).

The syntax of *for-of statements* is presented below:

.. code-block:: abnf

    forOfStatement:
        'for' '(' forVariable 'of' expression ')' statement
        ;

    forVariable:
        identifier | ('let' | 'const') identifier (':' type)?
        ;

A :index:`compile-time error` occurs if the type of an expression is not
``array``, ``string``, or an iterable type.

The execution of a ``for-of`` loop starts from the evaluation of ``expression``.
If the evaluation is successful, then the resultant expression is used for
loop iterations (execution of the ``statement``). On each iteration,
*forVariable* is set to successive elements of the ``array``, ``string``, or
the result of class iterator advancement.

.. index::
   for-of statement
   loop
   instance
   iterable class
   iterable interface
   iterable type
   expression
   type
   array
   string
   for-of loop
   evaluation
   loop iteration
   class iterator
   iteration
   statement

If *forVariable* has the modifiers ``let`` or ``const``, then a new variable
is declared in the loop scope. The new variable is accessible only inside the
loop body. Otherwise, the variable is as declared above.
The modifier ``const`` prohibits assignments into *forVariable*,
while ``let`` allows modifications.

The type of *forVariable* declared inside the loop is inferred to be that
of the *iterated* elements, namely:

-  ``T``, if ``Array<T>`` or ``FixedArray<T>`` instance is iterated;

-  ``string``, if ``string`` value is iterated;

-  Type argument of the *iterator*, if an instance of the *iterable* type
   is iterated.

If *forVariable* is declared outside the loop, then the type of an iterated
element must be assignable (see :ref:`Assignability`) to the type of the
variable. Otherwise, a :index:`compile-time error` occurs.

      console.log(s)
    }

    // new variable 's', its type is inferred from expression after 'of'
    for (let s of "a string object") {
      console.log(s)
    }

    // new variable 'element', its type is inferred from expression after 'of'.
    // as 'const' it cannot be assigned with a new value in the loop body
    for (const element of [1, 2, 3]) {
      console.log(element)
      element = 66 // Compile-time error as 'element' is 'const'
    }

Explicit type annotation of *forVariable* is allowed as an experimental
feature (see :ref:`For-of Explicit Type Annotation`).

.. _Break Statements:

``break``  Statements
*********************

.. meta:
    frontend_status: Done
    todo: break with label causes compile time assertion

A ``break`` statement transfers control out of the enclosing ``loopStatement``
or ``switchStatement``. If a ``break`` statement is used outside a
``loopStatement`` or a ``switchStatement``, then a :index:`compile-time error`
occurs.

.. index::
   break statement
   control transfer
   compile-time error
   control transfer
   switch statement
   loop statement
   syntax

The syntax of *break statement* is presented below:

.. code-block:: abnf

    breakStatement:
        'break' identifier?
        ;

A ``break`` statement with the label *identifier* transfers control out of the
enclosing statement with the same label *identifier*. If there is no enclosing
loop statement with the same label identifier (within the body of the
surrounding function or method), then a :index:`compile-time error` occurs.

A statement without a label transfers control out of the innermost enclosing
``switch``, ``while``, ``do``, ``for``, or ``for-of`` statement. If
``breakStatement`` is placed outside ``loopStatement`` or ``switchStatement``,
then a :index:`compile-time error` occurs.

Examples of ``break`` statements with and without a label are presented below:

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

    // Single iteration
    while (true) {
      console.log("iteration")  // get printed exactly once
      break;
    }

    let a: number = 0
    outer:
      do {
        for (a = 0; a < 10; a++) {
            if (a == 1) break outer
            console.log("inner")    // get printed only once
        }
        console.log(a) // Never reached
      } while (true)   // condition never used

.. _Continue Statements:

``continue`` Statements
***********************

.. meta:
    frontend_status: Done
    todo: continue with label causes compile time assertion

A ``continue`` statement stops the execution of the current loop iteration,
and transfers control to the next iteration. Appropriate checks of loop
exit conditions depend on the kind of the loop.

The syntax of *continue statement* is presented below:

.. code-block:: abnf

    continueStatement:
        'continue' identifier?
        ;

.. index::
   continue statement
   statement
   execution
   loop
   loop iteration
   control transfer
   iteration
   exit condition
   label
   syntax

A ``continue`` statement with no label transfers control to the next iteration
of the enclosing ``loop`` statement. If there is no enclosing ``loop`` statement
within the body of the surrounding function or method, then a
:index:`compile-time error` occurs.

A ``continue`` statement with the label *identifier* transfers control
to the next iteration of the enclosing loop statement with the same label
*identifier*.
If there is no enclosing loop statement with the same label *identifier*
(within the body of the surrounding function or method),
then a :index:`compile-time error` occurs.

Examples of ``continue`` statements with and without a label are presented below:

.. index::
   continue statement
   control transfer
   statement
   iteration
   surrounding function
   surrounding method
   enclosing statement

    // continue     // would cause CTE if uncommented

    // continue without label
    // will print 0, 1, 2, 4 (3 skipped)
    for (let a: number = 0; a < 5; a++){
      if (a == 3) continue
      console.log("a = " + a)
    }

    let a: number
    outer:
      do {
        for (a = 0; a < 10; a++) {
            if (a > 1) continue outer
            console.log("inner")    // get printed only twice
        }
        console.log("Outer") // Never reached
      } while (false)

.. _Return Statements:

``return`` Statements
*********************

.. meta:
    frontend_status: Done
    todo: return voidExpression

A ``return`` statement can have or not have an expression.

The syntax of *return statement* is presented below:

.. code-block:: abnf

    returnStatement:
        'return' expression?
        ;

A ``return`` statement with *expression* can only occur inside a function, a
method, or a lambda body with non-``void`` return type.

.. index::
   return statement
   statement
   expression
   syntax
   return expression
   function
   method
   lambda body
   return type
   method body
   function body
   constructor

A ``return`` statement (with no *expression*) can occur inside one of the
following:

- Initializer block;
- Constructor body;
- Function, method, or lambda body with return type ``void`` (see
  :ref:`Type void`);

A :index:`compile-time error` occurs if a ``return`` statement is found in:

-  Top-level statements (see :ref:`Top-Level Statements`);
-  Functions or methods with return type ``void`` (see :ref:`Type void`)
   that have an expression;
-  Functions or methods with a non-``void`` return type that have no
   expression.

.. index::
   return statement

   top-level statement
   function
   method
   void type
   return type
   class
   initializer
   constructor
   initializer block
   constructor body
   return type

The execution of a ``returnStatement`` leads to the termination of the
surrounding function, method, or initializer. If an *expression* is
provided, the resultant value is the evaluated *expression*.

In case of constructors, initializer blocks, and top-level statements, the
control is transferred out of the scope of the construction, but no result is
required. Other statements of the surrounding function, method body,
initializer block, or top-level statement are not executed.

.. _Switch Statements:

``switch`` Statements
*********************

.. meta:
    frontend_status: Done
    todo: non literal constant expression () in case ==> causes an assertion error
    todo: when there is only a default clause in switchBlock then the default's statements/block are not executed

A ``switch`` statement transfers control to a statement or a block by using the
result of successful evaluation of the value of a ``switch`` expression.

.. index::
   switch statement
   control transfer
   statement
   block
   evaluation
   switch expression

The syntax of *switch statement* is presented below:

.. code-block:: abnf

    switchStatement:
        (identifier ':')? 'switch' '(' expression ')' switchBlock
        ;

    switchBlock
        : '{' caseClause* defaultClause? caseClause* '}'
        ;

    caseClause
        : 'case' expression ':' statement*
        ;

    defaultClause
        : 'default' ':' statement*
        ;

A ``switch`` expression can be of any type.

If available, an optional identifier allows the ``break`` statement to transfer
control out of a nested ``switch`` or ``loop`` statement (see
:ref:`Break statements`).

.. index::
   syntax
   switch statement
   switch expression
   expression type
   identifier
   control transfer
   nested statement
   switch statement
   loop statement
   break statement

A :index:`compile-time error` occurs if at least one of case expression types
is not assignable (see :ref:`Assignability`) to the type of the ``switch``
statement expression.

.. index::
   expression
   expression type
   switch statement
   assignability

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

    let arg = prompt("Enter a value?");
    switch (arg) {
      case '0':
      case '1':
        console.log('One or zero')
        break
      case '2':
        console.log('Two')
        break
      default:
        console.log('An unknown value')
    }

    class A {}
    let a: A| null = assignIt()
    switch (a) {
      case null:
      case null: // One may have several case clauses with the same expression in
        console.log ("a is null")
        break
      case new A:
        console.log ("Never matches as new A is a new unique object")
        break
      default:
        console.log ("a is A")
    }
    function assignIt () {
        return new A
    }


The execution of a ``switch`` statement starts from the evaluation of the
``switch`` expression.

The value of the ``switch`` expression is compared repeatedly to the value
of case expressions. The comparison starts from the top and proceeds until the
first *match*. A *match* occurs when a particular case expression value equals
the value of the ``switch`` expression in terms of the operator '``==``'. The
execution is transferred to the set of statements of the *caseClause* where the
match occurred. If this set of statements executes a ``break`` statement, then
the entire ``switch`` statement terminates. If no ``break`` statement is
executed, then the execution continues through statements of any remaining
*caseClause* and *defaultClause* until the first ``break`` statement occurs,
or until the ``switch`` statement ends.

If no *match* occurs while a *defaultClause* is present, then the execution is
transferred to the statements of the *defaultClause*.

********************

.. meta:
    frontend_status: Done

A ``throw`` statement causes an *error* object to be created and raised
(see :ref:`Error Handling`). It immediately transfers control, and can exit
multiple statements, constructors, functions, and method calls until a ``try``
statement (see :ref:`Try Statements`) is found that catches the value thrown.
If no ``try`` statement is found, then ``UncaughtExceptionError`` is thrown.

The syntax of *throw statement* is presented below:

.. code-block:: abnf

    throwStatement:
        'throw' expression
        ;

The expression type must be assignable (see :ref:`Assignability`) to type
``Error``. Otherwise, a :index:`compile-time error` occurs.

This implies that the object thrown is never ``null``.

Errors can be thrown at any place in the code.

.. _Try Statements:

``try`` Statements
******************

.. meta:
    frontend_status: Done

A ``try`` statement runs block of code, and provides optional ``catch`` clause
to handle errors (see :ref:`Error Handling`) which may occur during block of
code execution.

.. index::
   try statement
   block
   catch clause

The syntax of *try statement* is presented below:

.. code-block:: abnf

    tryStatement:
          'try' block catchClause? finallyClause?
          ;

    catchClause:
          'catch' '(' identifier ')' block
          ;

    finallyClause:
          'finally' block
          ;

A ``try`` statement must contain either a ``finally`` clause, or a
``catch`` clause. Otherwise, a :index:`compile-time error` occurs.

If the ``try`` block completes normally, then no action is taken, and no
``catch`` clause block is executed.

If an error is thrown in the ``try`` block directly or indirectly, then the
control is transferred to the ``catch`` clause.

.. _Catch Statements:

``catch`` Clause
================

.. meta:
    frontend_status: Done

A ``catch`` clause consists of two parts:

-  A *catch identifier* that provides access to an object associated with
   the *error* thrown; and

-  A block of code that handles the error.

The type of *catch identifier* inside the block is ``Error`` (see
:ref:`Error Handling`).

.. index::
   catch clause
   catch identifier
   access
   error
   block
   catch identifier
   Object

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

    class ZeroDivisor extends Error {}

    function divide(a: number, b: number): number {
      if (b == 0)
        throw new ZeroDivisor()
      return a / b
    }

    function process(a: number, b: number): number {
      try {
        let res = divide(a, b)

        // further processing ...
        return res
      }
      catch (e) {
        return e instanceof ZeroDivisor? -1 : 0
      }
    }

A ``catch`` clause handles all errors at runtime. It returns '*-1*' for
the ``ZeroDivisor``, and '*0*'  for all other errors.

.. index::
   catch clause
   runtime
   function
   divisor

.. _Finally Clause:

``finally`` Clause
==================

.. meta:
    frontend_status: Done

A ``finally`` clause defines the set of actions in the form of a block to be
executed without regard to whether a ``try-catch`` completes normally or
abruptly.

The syntax of *finally clause* is presented below:

.. code-block:: abnf

    finallyClause:
        'finally' block
        ;

A ``finally`` block is executed without regard to how (by reaching ``return``
or ``try-catch`` end or raising new *error*) the program control is
transferred out. The ``finally`` block is particularly useful to ensure
proper resource management.

Any required actions (e.g., flush buffers and close file descriptors)
can be performed while leaving the ``try-catch``:

.. index::
   finally clause
   block
   execution
   try-catch
   normal completion
   abrupt completion
   syntax
   finally block
   execution
   return

.. code-block:: typescript

    class SomeResource {
      // some API
      // ...
      close() {}
    }

    function ProcessFile(name: string) {
      let r = new SomeResource()
      try {
        // some processing
      }
      finally {
        // finally clause will be executed after try-catch is
            executed normally or abruptly
        r.close()
      }
    }

.. _Try Statement Execution:

``try`` Statement Execution
===========================

.. meta:
    frontend_status: Done

#. A ``try`` block and the entire ``try`` statement complete normally if no
   ``catch`` block is executed. The execution of a ``try`` block completes
   abruptly if an error is thrown inside the ``try`` block. 

#. The the execution of a ``try`` block completes abruptly if error *x* is
   thrown inside the ``try`` block. If the ``catch`` clause is present, and the
   execution of the body of the ``catch`` clause completes normally, then the
   entire ``try`` statement completes normally. Otherwise, the ``try``
   statement completes abruptly.

#. If no ``catch`` clause is in place, then the error is propagated to the
   surrounding and caller scopes until reaching the scope with the ``catch``
   clause to handle the error. If there is no such scope, then the whole
   coroutine stack (see :ref:`Coroutines (Experimental)`) is discarded.
   Subsequent steps are then defined by the execution environment.

#. If ``finally`` clause is in place, and its execution completes abruptly, then
   the ``try`` statement also completes abruptly.
