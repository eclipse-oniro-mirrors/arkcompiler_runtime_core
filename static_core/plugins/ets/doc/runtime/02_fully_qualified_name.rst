.. _RT Fully Qualified Name:

Fully Qualified Name
********************

*Fully qualified name* is used to create unique identifiers for different types
and entities at runtime and in binary files. A *Fully qualified name* of an
entity is generated from its *unqualified name* by a build system, and
specific rules vary from one build system to another. However, the |LANG|
runtime expects concrete *fully qualified name* for some predefined types.
Such cases are described in
:ref:`Language Representation In Binary File <RT Language Representation In Binary File>`.
